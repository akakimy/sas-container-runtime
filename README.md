# SAS Container Runtime(SCR) - the Low Footprint, High Performance Container for SAS Models

<blockquote>
SAS Container Runtime is a lightweight OCI (Open Container Initiative)
compliant Docker container for executing SAS models. Models developed with SAS
Viya can be published to any container registry.  Users can take advantage of the cloud infrastructure to deploy applications with small footprint and are highly scalable and highly available. This ensures resources can be fully utilized to quickly execute the largest number of models and reduce the effort that is required to manage the environment.

SCR is now part of family of containers that Model Manager publishes: Python containers, R containers and AML containers.
