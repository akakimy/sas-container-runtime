# SAS Container Runtime Resources

SAS Container Runtime is a lightweight Open Container Initiative (OCI) compliant container that scores SAS models and decisions. This enables you to run models and decisions on any OCI compliant compute system, including clusters that are based on Docker and Kubernetes. Deployments to cloud or on-premises systems are both supported.

For more information, see [What Is SAS Container Runtime?](https://documentation.sas.com/doc/en/mascrtcdc/default/mascrtag/n0vobwu1imdrzin1xjuc8v717sw0.htm)
